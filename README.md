# Speed Reader

A minimal, fast speed reading trainer built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## What is Speed Reader?

Most people read around 200 words per minute, but when you focus on just one word at a time, you can read much faster. Speed Reader helps you train your reading fluency by displaying one word at a time at your chosen speed.

## Features

- Upload PDF, TXT, and other text files
- Drag & drop file upload
- Adjustable reading speed (200-800 WPM)
- Large, focused single-word display
- Progress tracking with visual progress bar
- Play/Pause/Reset controls
- Minimal, distraction-free UI
- Dark/light mode toggle

## Getting Started

Requirements:
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

Install and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/selvastics/readable.git
cd readable
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Upload a text file or PDF document.
3. Set your preferred reading speed (start with 300 WPM).
4. Click Start and focus on each word as it appears.
5. Use Pause/Resume and Reset controls as needed.

## Speed Reading Tips

- Start with comfortable speed (300-400 WPM) and gradually increase
- Focus on the center of each word to improve recognition
- Try not to subvocalize (say words in your head)
- Practice regularly to build reading fluency
- Use different types of texts to challenge yourself
